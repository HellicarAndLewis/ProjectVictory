  # MultiVideoStreamer 

  The multi video streamer will create multiple audio and video encoder instances
  and streams these to the specified servers. Some media server providers have a 
  feature to stream multiple quality video to their end users; this is when you 
  would use the MultiVideoStreamer.
 
  If you only need to stream one quality stream, use the VideoStreamer class.

  ---
  
  After you've successfully loaded the settings, setup() and start()ed the MultiVideoStreamer
  you can start adding video and audio packets. It's important that you use a MemoryPool to 
  handle packets. The memory pool uses a manual reference counting system to allow multiple
  encoder to work with the same data. YOU DO NOT HAVE TO THINK ABOUT THE REFERENCE COUNTS WHEN
  USING THIS CLASS. WE WILL ADD THE APPROPRIATE REFERENCE COUNTS FOR YOU!

  --- 

  The feature of using multiple quality video/audio streams has had a big influence on the 
  design of the whole Video Streamer library. This is the reason why we have a memory pool,
  where raw (input) video and audio data are shared between multiple video and audio 
  encoders. 

  IMPORTANT NOTE ABOUT AVPACKET
  -----------------------------

  It's important to know that I'm not entirely happy with the design of AVPacket and the way
  multiple video streams are handled. Though the current solution seems to be the most elegant
  I could think off to mix multi and basic streams into one AVPacket.  The thing is, that 
  the YUV420PGrabber creates one big texture that will hold all the texture/video data for 
  multiple streams (see this image where we have all the video data for 3 different sized
  video streams: http://www.flickr.com/photos/diederick/10027076563/ ). All this video data
  is assigned to the AVPacket::data member. We use strides and plane pointers to tell 
  the video encoder where to fetch it's data from. 

  Therefore, when using a multi packet. you need to assing all the strides + planes all the
  different streams are using. And this is where the "stream_id" member of VideoEncoder 
  comes to work.
